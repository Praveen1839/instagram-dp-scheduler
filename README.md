# Instagram DP Scheduler (Semi-Automated)

A simple Flask + Selenium-based web tool to help schedule and manage Instagram display picture (DP) changes.  
Since Instagram restricts profile picture uploads via automation, this project assists the user in navigating directly to the profile edit screen, where they can manually update the DP with ease.

---

# Features

- Upload DP image from a local file
- Set a target schedule time (for tracking/logging)
- Store Instagram credentials locally for automation
- View a history of all scheduled DP entries
- Automatically open Instagram and navigate to the Edit Profile page
- Simple and clean web UI using Flask + HTML

---

##  How It Works

1. Run the Flask web server using `app.py`
2. Access the form at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
3. Enter:
   - Instagram username
   - Password
   - Upload a DP image
   - Set a schedule time
4. Submission is stored in `schedule.json`
5. Run `dp_changer.py` to:
   - Log into Instagram
   - Go to the Edit Profile page
   - Prompt you to manually upload the image

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Flask** for web backend
- **HTML/CSS** for frontend UI
- **Selenium (Chrome WebDriver)** for browser automation
- **JSON** for schedule and login data storage
